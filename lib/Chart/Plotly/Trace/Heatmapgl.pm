=head1 NAME 

Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/heatmapgl.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WebGL version of the heatmap trace type.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#heatmapgl>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=cut

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether or not the colorscale is picked using the sign of the input z values.

=cut

has colorbar => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl::Colorbar",
);

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in z space, use zmin and zmax
