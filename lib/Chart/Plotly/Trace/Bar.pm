=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.

Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If *y* (the default value), the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If *y2*, the y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
