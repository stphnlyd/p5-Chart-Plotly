This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    my $plotly_meta = delete $hash{'pmeta'};
    if (defined $plotly_meta) {
        $hash{'meta'} = $plotly_meta;
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

    is => "rw",

=cut

    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the opacity of the trace.",

=item * r

Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the radial coordinates for legacy polar chart only.

=cut

    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .",
);

=item * showlegend

Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend.

=cut

=item * stream


=cut

has stream => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Stream",
);

=item * t

Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for legacy polar chart only.

=cut

has t => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the *barpolar* trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for legacy polar chart only.",

=item * transforms


=cut

has transforms => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|ArrayRef[Chart::Plotly::Trace::Area::Transform]",

=item * tsrc

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .

=cut

has tsrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .",
);

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=cut

has uid => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.",
);

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * visible

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).
